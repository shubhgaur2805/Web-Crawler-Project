# Postman_Assigment
## Step to run a code:
    You just need to run cmd `Python main.py` 
    Output: api_database.db and a Csv_file as Data
## Details of all the tables and their schema:
    There is Two tables in the database: -
	Table 1: Api_data has all meta data of API's
   	Table 2: Api_category_data has a name of all category in API

### To Recreate Tables 
    Run main.py file

## What is done from Points to Archive
    All Points are archived as given
   - [x] Your code should follow concept of OOPS
   - [x] Support for handling authentication requirements & token expiration of server
   - [x] Support for pagination to get all data
   - [x] Develop work around for rate limited server
   - [x] Crawled all API entries for all categories and stored it in a database

### Total Entries in Tables:
    Api_data: 525 Entries
    Api_category_data: 45 Entries

## What is not done from Points to Archive:
    N/A
    
## What would you improve if given more days
    If more days are given I would improve the efficency of code and also add a feature from which categroies at  which page data user want in database
